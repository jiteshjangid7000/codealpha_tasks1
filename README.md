# Simple Rule-Based Chatbot 

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates a simple **rule-based chatbot** using basic control structures like `if-elif`, `functions`, `loops`, and `input/output`.

 Goal

To build a basic chatbot that responds to specific user inputs with predefined replies.

 Key Concepts Used

- `if-elif-else` statements for rule-based logic
- `while` loop for continuous user interaction
- `functions` to organize code
- `input()` and `print()` for user interaction (I/O)

 Sample Interaction
 
Chatbot: Hello! Type something to start (type 'bye' to exit)
You: hello
Chatbot: Hi!
You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm fine, thanks!
You: bye
Chatbot: Goodbye!
